**WARNING: As previously announced on our communication channels, the Kytos
project will enter the "shutdown" phase on May 31, 2021. After this date,
only critical patches (security and core bug fixes) will be accepted, and the
project will be in "critical-only" mode for another six months (until November
30, 2021). For more information visit the FAQ at <https://kytos.io/faq>. We'll
have eternal gratitude to the entire community of developers and users that made
the project so far.**

    THIS NAPP IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL AND IT'S EVENTS, METHODS AND STRUCTURES MAY
    CHANGE A LOT ON THE NEXT FEW DAYS/WEEKS, USE IT AT YOUR OWN DISCERNEMENT

The NApp **kytos/pathfinder** is a NApp responsible for creating a graph with
the latest network topology and providing rest endpoint to calculate the best
path between two devices. In the network, each device is a host or a switch and
each link is a connection between two devices. In the graph, each device
represents a node and each link represents an edge between two nodes.

The NApp learns custom properties from the topology, being able to define the
best paths based on a weighted parmeter. Please see the Rest API documentation
for details.
